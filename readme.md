Nice Job.

Ericka try to create another branch called develop or dev, and upload all files there, 
Generally we use main or master branch when we are going to deploy our project to production, production is our server, hosting, cloud, etc.

Your local changes uploaded to develop branch and develop branch will be merged to main or master using a pull request.
